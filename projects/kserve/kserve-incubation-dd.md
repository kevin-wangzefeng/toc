# KServe Incubation Due Diligence

- Link to [Incubation application issue](https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1367)

<!-- This template provides the TOC with the outline for completing due diligence of a project to move levels. This universal template is designed to capture all criteria so the TOC may ensure prior level criteria do not regress. As part of completing the due diligence, the TOC member should update the template to convey the level the project applied for the criteria by bolding the level indicated where the criteria is relevant. -->

### Suggested

- [ ] **Clear and discoverable project governance documentation.**

<!-- (TOC Evaluation goes here) --> 
  - [Project governance doc](https://github.com/kserve/community/blob/main/KSERVE-TECHICAL-CHARTER.md)

- [ ] **Governance has continuously been iterated upon by the project as a result of their experience applying it, with the governance history demonstrating evolution of maturity alongside the project's maturity evolution.**

   KServe project Governance has iterated organically as it has gained experienced over the years. Contributor Roles and contributor ladder processes are streamlined over the past years as well as team member onboarding/offboarding process is well defined. The Project has currently 15 active committers and maintainers and it has received contributions from 267 contributors who come from different companies.
